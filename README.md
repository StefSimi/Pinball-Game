## Pinball Game

## About

This project is a 2D pinball game developed using OpenGL and GLUT, featuring realistic physics, interactive elements, and textured game objects. The game includes dynamic flippers, bumpers, and walls, providing an engaging arcade experience with smooth gameplay.

## Features

-Physics-Based Ball Movement – Implements accurate collision detection and response, ensuring natural interactions between the ball and obstacles.<br>
-Interactive Flippers – Controlled via mouse clicks, the flippers dynamically push the ball based on impact position and velocity.<br>
-Bumpers and Walls – Various obstacles affect the ball’s movement, applying different force multipliers for diverse gameplay mechanics.<br>
-Textured Graphics – Game objects, including the playfield and bumpers, are enhanced with textures for a polished look.<br>
-Custom Shaders – Uses GLSL shaders to manage colors and transformations efficiently.<br>
-Optimized Rendering – Employs matrix transformations and OpenGL buffers for smooth and responsive rendering.<br>

## Controls
-Left Mouse Button – Activates the left flipper. <br>
-Right Mouse Button – Activates the right flipper. <br>
-Spacebar – Launches the ball into play. <br>
-ESC – Exits the game. <br>
